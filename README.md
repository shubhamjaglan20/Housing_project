# 🧠 California Housing Price Prediction Project

This repository contains an **end-to-end Machine Learning project** from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*. It walks through a complete ML workflow using the California housing dataset.

## 📚 Project Overview

This notebook covers the full pipeline of a supervised regression task — predicting median house values in California districts based on various features.

### 🔍 Key Topics Covered:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing data
- Feature engineering
- Data transformation with pipelines
- Encoding categorical attributes
- Building and evaluating models
- Cross-validation
- Identifying underfitting/overfitting
- Trying different ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
- Model tuning and improvement

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
